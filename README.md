# Zero-Trust Security on Document Certification System
Our project is to study the Zero-Trust concept with a document certification system for protecting documents from an insider like developers or admins that want to edit or change the document information before it sends to the user's interface, Where the user can read and see their requested document. We will use a Zero-Trust concept to identify developers, admins, and insiders to identify themself before edit and access to the document by using security techniques such as Biometric identification, VPN, or IP address to check that they are in the organization and to protect suspicious act from attacks inside the organization.
